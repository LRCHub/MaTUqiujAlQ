Don't be light

Don't be light
Don't be light
Maybe like me

Don't be light
Don't be light
Don't be light
Maybe like me

Don't be light

Don't

Don't
Don't be light
Don't
Maybe like me

Don't be light
Don't be light
Don't be light
Maybe like me

Don't be light

Don't be light, don't be light
Ahh, wild life
The gray surprises of our days
Singing in caves
Fabricating a new abandon

We don't see the master's hand
We bang on gold tambourines
In the cross hairs of some transient gun
Trading desires on the banquet line

La la la
La la la
La la la

Don't
Don't be light
Don't
Maybe like me

Don't be light
Don't be light
Don't be light
Maybe like me

Don't be light
